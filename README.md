### Hi! 👋
I'm Nicole Chung, a Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.

## About Me

🌱 I’m constantly learning through various passion projects! Currently, I'm working on a collaborative trip-planning web app to get familiar with TypeScript and React, and developing firmware for the remote control of an E-Skateboard!

🔭 I’m in search of a software engineering co-op for Summer or Fall 2024
