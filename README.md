### Hi!
I'm Nicole Chung, I'm a Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo and I’m constantly learning through various passion projects! 

## About Me

🌱 Currently, I'm working with Electrium Mobility (a UWaterloo Design Team) developing their discord server's bot and configuring the backend of their React/Typescript website! I'm also completing CodeAcademy's TypeScript course and working on a personal website.

🔭 I’m in search of a 4-month software engineering co-op for January or May start date in 2025 :)

📚 My favorite books right now are: <br>
- <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58784475-tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow">Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin</a>, a "multilayered novel about friendship, love, and video games". <br>
- <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34376766-blood-sweat-and-pixels?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=3qlFXQtbtg&rank=1">Blood, Sweat, and Pixels by Jason Schreier</a>, an enticing non-fiction read on the real-life struggles and successes behind popular video games. This is one of the books Gabrielle Zevin cited in the acknowledgements of her novel!
