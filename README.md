### Hi! I'm Nicole and I’m constantly learning through various passion projects ♥︎

## About Me

🌱 I am currently completing my third year of computer engineering at UWaterloo!

My favorite course right now is <a href="https://uwflow.com/course/ece350">Real-Time Operating Systems</a>, a continuation of <a href="https://uwflow.com/course/ece252">Systems Programming and Concurrency</a> from last term. Other courses I am currently enjoying include <a href="https://uwflow.com/course/ece327">Digital Hardware Systems</a> and <a href="https://uwflow.com/course/ece380">Analog Control Systems</a> :)

🔭 I’m actively seeking a software engineering co-op with a start date of May or Sept 2026

📚 My favorite books right now are: <br>
- <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58784475-tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow">Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin</a>, a fictional "multilayered novel about friendship, love, and video games". <br>
- <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34376766-blood-sweat-and-pixels?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=3qlFXQtbtg&rank=1">Blood, Sweat, and Pixels by Jason Schreier</a>, an enticing non-fiction read on the real-life struggles and successes behind popular video games. This book is one of the sources cited for research in the aforementioned novel!
